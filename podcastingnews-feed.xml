	<title>Remix Sanctuary, an Experimental Sci-Fi Film</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right"  alt="Michela_Ledwidg.jpg" src="http://www.podcastingnews.com/images/Michela_Ledwidg.jpg" width="120" height="143" /&gt;Interesting opportunity for video podcasters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indie filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;Michela Ledwidge&lt;/strong&gt; is developing a short film, &lt;strong&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/strong&gt;, to explore the potential for audiences to play with film as though it were a musical instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She believes audiences should be able to ‘fiddle with film’ as though it were a musical instrument, using a games console or desktop computer to modify the movie as they watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Technology and online culture have changed the relationship between film-makers and their audience. Relationships are no longer one way. As a film-maker, performer and technical architect, I have always seen film as a two-way interactive experience,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>New York Times: All the News that's Fit to Podcast</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The New York Times today announced that it launched a new podcasting initiative on January 26.  The &lt;a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/forum/links.php?func=showfeed&amp;id=5152"&gt;New York Times Front Page podcast&lt;/a&gt; is a synopsis of the top stories of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is just one of the ways we're expanding New York Times journalism into various forms of multimedia as we grow to meet the needs of our audience," said Vivian Schiller, senior vice president of The New York Times Television and Video. "Audio - and video - are natural extensions of our reporting and our brand."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Techworld: Companies Must Update Security Practice to Handle Portable Media Players</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;TechWorld has published an article discussing the risks that iPods and other portable MP3 players pose in a corporate environment, and also some of the potential benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The capacities at this high end equate to a laptop drive. This means that vast amounts of corporate data can be removed on a small consumer device that sits in the pocket.

&lt;p&gt;Introducing measures to prevent such devices from connecting to corporate resources are failing. As fast as vendors bring out software to identify and block the devices, device manufacturers and software companies are releasing utilities to hide the devices from network administrators. "&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>First Haute Podcast? Karl Lagerfeld Announces Fashion Show Video Podcast</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="lagerfield_podcast.jpg" src="http://www.podcastingnews.com/images/lagerfield_podcast.jpg" width="100" height="186" /&gt;Fashion guru Karl Lagerfeld has announced that he plans to close New York Fashion Week on Friday, February 10th, with his F/W '06 show and a fashion first - the debut of the Karl Lagerfeld/Lagerfeld Collection lines via a video podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Lagerfeld, the video podcast will be the first fashion show to be made available as a podcast on the iTunes Music Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lagerfeld is working with COREaudiovisual production company and using Apple software, such as Final Cut Studio and the HD video production suite, to enable the production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runway show will be taped in HD and edited on-site using Final Cut Pro editing software with Motion- based graphics added in a near real-time process. Aperture, Apple's post-production tool for  photographers, will be used to let Lagerfeld immediately compare thousands of images and cull them down to select moments from the runway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Most Expensive, Deadliest iPod Accessory Ever</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Britain has launched "deadliest and most expensive warship" ever, the HMS Daring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="iPod_Warship.jpg" src="http://www.podcastingnews.com/images/iPod_Warship.jpg" width="250" height="177" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weighing 7,350 tonnes, her 14 decks bristling with the latest technology, the Daring features a Principal Anti-Air Missile System, which is said to be able to trace and destroy hostile objects as small a cricket ball travelling at three times the speed of sound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship's PAAMS air defense missiles are the size of a public phone box, weigh two thirds as much as a small car and from launch, accelerate to a speed twice that of Concorde in under 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daring's secret weapon, though, may be its built-in iPod support. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Your Senator Needs an iPod</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="iPod_senators.jpg" src="http://www.podcastingnews.com/images/iPod_senators.jpg" width="120" height="83" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IPac&lt;/strong&gt;, a nonpartisan group dedicated to preserving individual freedom through balanced intellectual property policy, is leading a campaign to make all US senators iPod owners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on the "Broadcast Flag" and "Audio Flag," a set of proposals by the MPAA and RIAA that many believe would stifle innovation, by giving content holders a virtual veto over new technologies and existing user rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Senator Stevens, the 82-year old committee chairman from Alaska, surprised the audience by announcing that his daughter had bought him an iPod, and suddenly Stevens had a much greater understanding of the many ways innovative technology can create choice for consumers. Content industry representatives at the hearing found themselves answering much tougher questions than they typically receive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Apple Sued Over iPod User's Hearing Damage</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="nano_white.gif" src="http://www.podcastingnews.com/images/nano_white.gif" width="61" height="100" align="right"/&gt;John Kiel Patterson of Louisiana, an Apple iPod user, has filed suit in U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, seeking compensation for unspecified damages, and to force upgrades that could make iPods safer to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, the portable music players are "inherently defective in design and are not sufficiently adorned with adequate warnings regarding the likelihood of hearing loss.''&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>2006 SuperBowl Commercials Video Podcast</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.videopodcastingnews.com/2006/02/02/2006-superbowl-commercials-watch-super-bowl-ads/"&gt;Video Podcasting News&lt;/a&gt;: Mainstream media has been a little slow to get on the video podcast bandwagon. It’s not surprising, then, that there isn’t an official Super Bowl ad video podcast, despite the fact that there are some people that watch the game specifically to see the ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevLib has created a feed for the Super Bowl ads and plans to upload the commercials and have them available for downloading as a video podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="go_daddy_superbowl_ad.jpg" src="http://www.podcastingnews.com/images/go_daddy_superbowl_ad.jpg" width="250" height="107" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect ads from Budweiser, Sprint, Toyota, GM Burger King, Cadillac, Gillette - and something as controversial as possible from Go Daddy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>New Sony Field Recorder Expensive, but Sexy</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="sony_field_recorder.jpg" src="http://www.podcastingnews.com/images/sony_field_recorder.jpg" width="120" height="233" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;NAMM Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Sony showed its new &lt;strong&gt;PCM-D1 portable recorder&lt;/strong&gt;. Sony says that the PCM-D1 has &lt;em&gt;"quickly become popular among audio pros, recognized as much for its distinctive styling as for its exceptional sound recording quality."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recorder, which began shipping in December, is designed to produce digital stereo recordings that are faithful to the original source. The PCM-D1 can be used for high-quality recording in an array of applications including live sound, house of worship and theatrical performance, as well as by journalists in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The PCM-D1 is a significant advance in high-quality field recording technology," said Paul Foschino, senior manager for professional audio in Sony Electronics' Broadcast and Production Systems Division. "Beyond its technical design, the unit is equally distinguished by an unmistakable 'cool factor.' And to help minimize resonance, the casing is formed from pure 1mm thick pressed titanium that's harder than alumite-treated aluminum, making its physical presence as distinctive as its sound quality."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Tartan Podcast, Podshow Part Ways</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mark Hunter’s &lt;a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/forum/links.php?func=showfeed&amp;id=1723"&gt;Tartan Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, a music podcast dedicated to Scotland's indie music scene, recently disappeared from the Podshow Network lineup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have in fact left podshow, asking in writing for my contract to be terminated with immediate effect," comments Hunter. "I wasn’t happy with the direction the company was moving in, was unable to open a dialogue with them about my concerns, the vibe that was created when I joined last June wasn’t sustained (sadly), and while there are some great, passionate, visionary-types working for the company it would seem that they aren’t the driving force."&lt;/p&gt;</description>
