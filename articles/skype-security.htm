<td align="left" valign="top" width="613">&nbsp;<h1>Skype Security Information</h1>
<p>So what differentiates Skype from a lot of similar programs released 
those days in enormous quantities? Unlike other VoIP software, Skype used and 
still uses a P2P architecture which isn't a surprise actually if we recall the 
other products by Skype's creators. P2P is one of the main advantages of Skype: 
all voice traffic goes through nodes of the network each one being a user 
itself. So the more users are using the system, the better it works. Skype 
routes calls through computers of other users, and that allows users behind NAT 
or a firewall to connect with each other. By the time when Skype had been 
released, the VoIP market was overwhelmed with software and hardware products 
working via the SIP protocol - which definitely deserves to be reviewed in 
details. Unlike the closed Skype protocol, SIP is completely open-sourced, well 
developed and is simple for hardware implementation. As a sample protocol 
for SIP the HTTP protocol was used - SIP messages just like HTTP queries are 
sent via Internet in the text form, and their formats are very similar. This 
makes developing and debugging of SIP supporting programs easier, and quite 
likely that was one of the reasons of the high popularity of the SIP protocol. 
Just like Skype, SIP isn't centralized; there are multiple servers, and in fact 
anyone can setup its own server; all servers are connected to and interact with 
each other. The protocol merely establishes and manages the communication, while 
the type of communication data can vary. Not only voice data can be sent; this 
could be video, multimedia or interactive services as well. SIP is oriented to 
work in local networks and through Internet connections of wide bandwidths.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="skype-lock.png" width="302" height="274"></p>
<p>Skype is an exact antithesis of SIP, though some data point that it was modified 
SIP that lies in the basis of Skype. Be that as it may, there are still more 
than enough differences between them: Skype - is a closed protocol, and due to 
its P2P structure it uses forced encryption (data are encrypted using AES-256, 
and to transfer the key, a 1024-bit RSA key is used in its turn. Public user 
keys are certified at the central Skype server when a user logs in, using 1536- 
or 2048-bit RSA certificates), and it handles extreme conditions much better 
than SIP. &quot;Throw it out of the door, and it comes back through the window&quot; - 
this phrase describes Skype's behavior best of all - if you close common range 
of UDP ports, it will switch to available TCP ones, and if things goes tougher, 
Skype can always use an HTTP-proxy. Some experts claim the only way to block 
Skype completely is to analyze all packets it sends - and they are encrypted, 
remember? All other simpler methods can't do anything with the program. The 
mentioned problem seriously worries special services of many countries in the 
world - some info can't be intercepted and decrypted - catastrophic! Though 
Switzerland, Australia, Austria, Germany and Russia have already implied that 
they have solutions to intercept Skype talks. Skype is often criticized by many 
security experts, even hackers. In 2007, in the 100th issue of the Russian 
&quot;Hacker&quot; magazine, Chris Kaspersky authored a long article entitled as &quot;Skype: 
hidden menace&quot;. &quot;Skype is a black-box with a multi-level encryption system&quot;, 
said Chris, &quot;it is stuffed with methods to prevent debugging of the executable, 
and it reads your private information and sends it via Internet using a closed 
protocol. The latter avoids firewalls and strongly masks traffic to prevent 
blocking attempts. All of these make Skype an ideal way to transmit viruses, 
worms and drones creating their own network using existing Skype's resources&quot;.<br>
<br>
But Skype captivated such wide audience no only with its encryption strength and 
resourcefulness, but also with two important things: simplicity and quality 
sound. Starting from the very first version released in fall 2003 Skype 
supported 10 languages and had extremely simple interface - unlike other IM's it 
was initially designed for voice calls. The ease of setup and registration of a 
new user processes also played a role. As for codecs, Skype uses SVOPC (16 kHz), 
AMR-WB (16 kHz), G.729 (8 kHz) and G.711 (it used to work also with ILBC and 
ISAC in the past), which allows receiving sound quality comparable with a usual 
phone line as long as you have sufficient connection speed [30-60 Kbit/s].<br>
